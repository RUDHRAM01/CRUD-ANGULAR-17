Angular project

First we have to create new project:
ng new project_name


then we can add require packages like bootstrap


then we will create the module using the ----> ng g module module_name   [here g stands for the generate] 

then we will create the components for that module using the -----> ng g c module_name/index

in this project we are going to perform the crud operation using the angular js so now we will create the component for that

create the component for the edit,view,create using the commond ---> ng g c module_name/component_name

now here
